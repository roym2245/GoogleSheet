### Small Project using Google Sheets and Bike Data from NY

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Open the Bike data from NY in Google Sheets.
   - Remove duplicates and blank data:
     - Utilize built-in functions or filters to identify and remove duplicates.
     - Filter out or delete rows with blank data entries.

2. **Pivot Charts**
   - Create pivot tables and charts to analyze the bike data:
     - Summarize data by categories such as date, station, bike ID, etc.
     - Generate pivot charts (e.g., bar charts, line charts) to visualize trends and patterns in the data.

3. **Min-Max, Average, Median Analysis**
   - Perform statistical analysis on the data:
     - Calculate minimum, maximum, average, and median values for relevant metrics (e.g., trip duration, distance traveled).
     - Utilize built-in Google Sheets functions (e.g., MIN, MAX, AVERAGE, MEDIAN) for calculations.
     - Highlight outliers.

### Summary
This project involves cleaning the bike data from NY by removing duplicates
and blank entries. Then, pivot charts are created to visualize trends,
followed by statistical analysis to determine metrics such as minimum, 
maximum, average, and median values.
Google Sheets provides a user-friendly platform for these tasks,
allowing for efficient data analysis.
